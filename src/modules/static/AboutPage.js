      <h1>Your neighbourhood, delivered.</h1>
      <p>
        Mangaloo connects you with the food, grocery and everyday-essential shops around you — and
        brings your order right to your door.
      </p>

    <div className="info-body">
      <p>
        We started Mangaloo with a simple belief: the best shops are often the ones already near
        you. Instead of pulling everything into one giant warehouse, we help the local shops you
        already trust reach you faster — with live order tracking and a personal shopper who picks
        your items with care.
      </p>
