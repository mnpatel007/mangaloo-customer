## Getting Started

For the complete local development setup — installing WSL, Docker, Node, cloning
all five Mangaloo repos, seeding the database, and running everything
together — see the
[`backend` repo's README](https://github.com/mnpatel007/mangaloo-backend#readme).
That's the single source of truth for setup; once it's done, come back here and
run `npm start` in this repo (`http://localhost:3000`).
